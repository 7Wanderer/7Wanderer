- 👋 Hi, I’m Nahyan, a software engineering student at the University of Sheffield. Nice to meet you!
  
- 👀 There are two things I'm rather passionate about. Games, and music.
  I'm part of a metal band, where I play drums, piano and do backing vocals. I also write a lot of our music and lyrics.
  My goal, however, isn't in music as it is just a hobby - rather, it is to be a game developer. Development is an industry that I am confident I can find success in.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# via Monogame. Also at university I have learned Java and Ruby (via sinatra, using the MVC programming paradigm). In the future, I hope to teach myself C++ as well, through the Godot game engine.
  
- 💞️ I’m currently seeking work placements for my sandwich course at university. I am in my second year, and feel a placement would give me valuable insight and experience in the field I wish to be a part of.
  
- 📫 You can contact me via email (KhaNahyan.022@gmail.com). Thank you very much!
